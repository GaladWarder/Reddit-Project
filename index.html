									<h1>The Goal</h1>
								</header>
								<span class="image left special"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>The goal of this project is to provide professional art and graphic design to anyone who needs or wants it, entirely for free. </h3>
								<p>I have worked in the art/graphic design industry for around 5 years now, and one common problem I have seen over and over again is the issue of money. How much is an artist's time worth?
								How do you find a solid artist at an affordable price? And why is my logo going to cost me so much? It's just ink on paper! I've seen so many businesses try to keep costs low, ending up
								with a sub-par or unworkable branding scheme, freelancers who do the bare minimum required, and good ideas lost or abandoned in the early stages of development, because they don't stand out.
								<br>
								<br>
								The thing is, I don't think either party is to blame. A small business owner who has taken out loans or sunk savings into their passion understandably wants to keep their costs as low as 
								they can until their business gets on its feet. And artists who have dedicated years of their life to their craft only to have to work tirelessly to keep revenue coming in, can hardly 
								be blamed for doing only what they have to in order to get to the next job. In all cases, the sticking point is money. Money can prevent great ideas from blossoming, or nurture them into full bloom. 
								Money is what can either prevent artists from pursuing their dream project, or help them make a lasting mark on society. Most successful partnerships between an artist and client are a result of the 
								monetary exchange being right for both sides.</p>
								
								<h4>So what if we change the rules?</h4>
								
								<p>What if the focus shifts from the money exchanged to the relationship and the end result? I believe that if the foremost goal of each party is the other's well-being, everyone can live happily and great things can 
								come from the partnership. This project is my way of putting my money, (and time, in this case), where my mouth is. A world of people looking out for each other is a great world, and this is my way of moving towards it.</p>
								<h1>How Does It Work?</h1>
								<p>^need to shorten/edit back - too verbose. Need to avoid creating a hypothetical conflict while still getting point across. HDIW section needs to be clear, soncise, short. Need FAQ
								section after it. Need to figure out whether to keep the form or replace it with more streamlined solution - 3rd party site maybe? (think Mailchimp) Need Paypal integration. About section needs to be filled out, 
								and placeholder images need to be replaced. One small image per section, could skip the middle one potentially if too visually busy.</p>

										<h2>Why are you doing this?</h2>
										<p>
											I started this project as a way to grow as an artist, to support as many communities as possible, and to see if a donation-based business model was viable for an individual.
											I love using what abilities I have to help others chase their dreams in a format that is accessible, and I want to see if it is possible to do so indefinitely. 
											I want to challenge the existing small business model, and I want to spread the love as much as I can, starting on a small scale and increasing as much as I am able.
										</p>

										<span class="image left special"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<h2>What will my donation be used for?</h2>
										<p>
											Any donations will be used first and foremost for the upkeep of this site, and for any materials or resources needed to continue the project. If there is extra after those 
											needs have been seen to, the funds will be set aside to upgrade my small drawing tablet to something more robust. This will allow me to be more mobile, and it will allow me
											to work faster. I currently do all digital work with a small entry-level Wacom Draw tablet.
