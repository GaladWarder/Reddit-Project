									<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Using the contact form at the bottom of this page, you provide me with some very basic information about the work you need. I will contact you at the email provided to figure out
								any details necessary, and then start working! You should receive a digital copy of the finished work within about 7 business days. Pretty simple, right?</p>
								
								<p>If you are satisfied with the work, you have the option to 'pay it forward' for the next person in line by donating whatever amount fits your budget.
								You can use the 'Donate via Paypal' button at the bottom of this page, or the link in the footer of any of our email correspondence. Every bit helps keep the project running,
								but you aren't obligated in any way to donate. If money's tight but you still want to help, tell a friend about the project or link to it on social media - help me spread the love!</p2>
								
								<header>
									<h2>Who Is Eligible For Free Art?</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Everyone! The project is primarily targeted at startups and small businesses, but I am more than happy to help individuals as well with things like Twitch or YouTube branding, wedding
								logos and graphics, or miscellaneous art requests.</p>
								
								<header>
									<h2>What Do You Get Out Of This?</h2>
								</header>
								<p>A combination of things. I will get practice in quick delivery with 
								a wide range of clients and projects. I will get a wide range of work to choose from when refining and updating my portfolio, and I hope to make relationships and connections with some
								awesome people and businesses! Finally, I have another project involving Reddit which I would like to pursue in the future, so this will give me some exposure and name recognition.</p>
								
								<header>
									<h2>When Will The Project End?</h2>
								</header>
								<p>This project, at least in its current form, will go through the end of February 2018. At that point, I should have a pretty good idea of if it is sustainable, if it is making an impact/helping,
								and how to improve it and work on a larger scale. As long as it is helping people, and viable logistically for me to continue, I will make any changes needed at that point, and (hopefullly)
								continue indefinitely!<p>

										<h2>Why Are You Doing This?</h2>
										<p>
											I started this project as a way to grow as an artist, to support as many communities as possible, and to see if a donation-based business model was viable for an individual.
											I love using what abilities I have to help others chase their dreams in a format that is accessible, and I want to see if it is possible to do so indefinitely. 
											I want to challenge the existing small business model, and I want to spread the love as much as I can, starting on a small scale and increasing as much as I am able.
										</p>

										<h2>What Are The Donations Used For?</h2>
										<p>
											Any donations will be used first and foremost for the upkeep of this site, and for any materials or resources needed to continue the project. If there is extra after those 
											needs have been seen to, the funds will be set aside to upgrade my small drawing tablet to something more robust. This will allow me to be more mobile, and it will allow me
											to work faster. I currently do all digital work with a small entry-level Wacom Draw tablet.
