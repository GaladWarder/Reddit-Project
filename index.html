									<h1>How It Works</h1>
								</header>
								<p>At the bottom-right of this page, you will find a button to get in contact with me. </p>
								<p>more text</p2>
								<p>^need to shorten/edit back - too verbose. Need to avoid creating a hypothetical conflict while still getting point across. HDIW section needs to be clear, soncise, short. Need FAQ
								section after it. Need to figure out whether to keep the form or replace it with more streamlined solution - 3rd party site maybe? (think Mailchimp) Need Paypal integration. About section needs to be filled out, 
								and placeholder images need to be replaced. One small image per section, could skip the middle one potentially if too visually busy.</p>

										<h2>Why are you doing this?</h2>
										<p>
											I started this project as a way to grow as an artist, to support as many communities as possible, and to see if a donation-based business model was viable for an individual.
											I love using what abilities I have to help others chase their dreams in a format that is accessible, and I want to see if it is possible to do so indefinitely. 
											I want to challenge the existing small business model, and I want to spread the love as much as I can, starting on a small scale and increasing as much as I am able.
										</p>

									<div class="column">
										<span class="image left special"><img src="images/donationuse.png" alt="" /></span>
										<h2>What are the donations used for?</h2>
										<p>
											Any donations will be used first and foremost for the upkeep of this site, and for any materials or resources needed to continue the project. If there is extra after those 
											needs have been seen to, the funds will be set aside to upgrade my small drawing tablet to something more robust. This will allow me to be more mobile, and it will allow me
											to work faster. I currently do all digital work with a small entry-level Wacom Draw tablet.

									<h3>About Me</h3>
									<p>Hello! My name is Grant Roberts, I am a 24 year old graphic artist and developer. My wife, Stephanie, and I love to travel and are currently based in Hong Kong. In my free time,
